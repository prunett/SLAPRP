Branch-Cut-and-Price algorithm for solving the Storage Location Assignment and Picker Routing Problem.

## Description

This repository implements the code from the paper "The Storage Location Assignment and Picker Routing Problem: A Generic Branch-Cut-and-Price Algorithm" authored by T. Prunet, N. Absi and D. Cattaruzza. The paper is currently under peer-review but a preprint is available on [https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13570](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13570).
